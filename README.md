## Hand Replayer

### Description
I developed this ShinyApp in 2020 to review my online poker hands.  
<br>  
### Usage
First, download this [hand history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murilogmamaral/hand_replayer/main/HH20200724%20T2967580470%20No%20Limit%20Hold'em%20US%24%200%2C23%20%2B%20US%24%200%2C02.txt). It's a _.txt_ file. Then, go to [https://mypokerstudies.shinyapps.io/replayer/](https://mypokerstudies.shinyapps.io/replayer/) to see the deployed app and upload the hand history. You can navigate through the different moments of the tournament and see how I played each hand. Or you can upload your own hand history.  
<br>  
### Details  
For now, this is not an open source app, but we can discuss part of the code! Just send me a message.
